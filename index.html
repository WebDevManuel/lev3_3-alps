            <h1>Choose your trip</h1>
            <p>We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of comfort and quality, and a solid value
                to our guests. These inns offer a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional
                cuisine, and authentic charm. They are typically small, independently-owned properties which reflect the
                character and hospitality of the surrounding alpine community. We know the owners personally, have a
                longstandingrelationship with them, and we find they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an
                exceptional experience.</p>
